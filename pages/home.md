Hi, I’m Willis, and I’m addicted to coding.

I currently work as a Web Developer at [Noble Studios](https://noblestudios.com/) in Reno, NV. I graduated in May of 2019 with a bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering from the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/cse). 

My passion is creating things that people use and love.

### **Languages I use and love:** 

❤️Python, Swift, JavaScript, CSS (SCSS really), HTML (you decide if this counts), PHP (turns out it isn't that bad)

### **Frameworks I've used recently:**

❤️Django (Python), React (JS), Express (JS), Vue (JS), Vapor (Swift)

### **Database I have the most experience in:**

❤️PostgreSQL

### **Featured side-projects (newest first):**

* [EVsnap](https://www.evsnap.com/): Buy & Sell Used Electric Cars (March 2020 - Present)
* [EVword](https://evword.com/): EV News Site (December 2019 - Present)
* [Fastme](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fastme-fasting-tracker/id1451575216): Simple fasting tracker app (April 2019 - Present)
* [Bwavy](http://www.bwavy.com/): Free Podcast Hosting (December 2017 - December 2019)

  * Technically this site is still live and still functional, but I don't plan on providing continued support on it (I just can't bare the thought of killing it).
