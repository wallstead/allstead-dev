Hey, I’m Willis. I like coding and creating stuff. Check out my [Personal GitHub](https://github.com/wallstead) to see some of my work or check out my [Work GitHub](https://github.com/willisallstead) to see that I have, in fact, been busy.

<img class="my-portrait" src="/static/img/willis-allstead.jpeg" alt="Willis Allstead (me)">

I've been working as a Web Developer at [Noble Studios](https://noblestudios.com/) in Reno, NV since May of 2018. I get to work on some [really](https://travelnevada.com/) [cool](https://tahoesouth.com/) [websites](https://duncanchannon.com/). I graduated in May of 2019 with a bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering from the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/cse). 

My passion is creating things that people use and love. I'm currently working on an [accessibility testing](https://siteally.com) service called Siteally. (See my most recent project below).

  * Technically this site is still live and still functional, but I don't plan on providing continued support on it (I just can't bare the thought of killing it).

### Outside of Work

 If I’m not coding, I’m probably spending time with friends, listening to music, snowboarding, hiking, camping, backpacking, or planning one of those things!

I also enjoy going out for coffee or tea, and if I'm home there's a good chance I'm listening to a podcast.
