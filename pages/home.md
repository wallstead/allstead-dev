Hi, I’m Willis, and I’m addicted to coding.

<!-- ![Willis Allstead (me)](/static/img/willis-allstead.jpeg) -->
<img class="my-portrait" src="/static/img/willis-allstead.jpeg" alt="Willis Allstead (me)">

I've been working as a Web Developer at [Noble Studios](https://noblestudios.com/) in Reno, NV since May of 2018. I graduated in May of 2019 with a bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering from the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/cse). 

My passion is creating things that people use and love. I've recently developed an interest in electric vehicles and alternative transportation (See my most recent side projects below). [Let me know](/contact/) if you'd like to work with me on anything related to those ideas.

❤️: My favorite right now (subject to change)

### **Languages I use and love:**

❤️ Python, PHP, JavaScript, CSS (SCSS really), HTML (you decide if this counts)

### **Frameworks/CMSs I'm familiar with:**

❤️ Django (Python), React (JS), Express (JS), Vue (JS), Vapor (Swift), WordPress (PHP)

### **DBs I have the most experience in:**

❤️ PostgreSQL, MySQL

### **Featured side-projects (newest first):**

* [EVsnap](https://www.evsnap.com/): Buy & Sell Used Electric Cars (March 2020 - Present)
<!-- * [EVword](https://evword.com/): EV News Site (December 2019 - Present) -->
* [Fastme](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fastme-fasting-tracker/id1451575216): Simple fasting tracker app (April 2019 - Present)
* [Bwavy](http://www.bwavy.com/): Free Podcast Hosting (December 2017 - December 2019)

  * Technically this site is still live and still functional, but I don't plan on providing continued support on it (I just can't bare the thought of killing it).

### **Outside of work:**

I love doing things outdoors with friends and family. If I'm not working, I'm probably running, snowboarding, hiking, camping, backpacking, or playing tennis with friends!

I also enjoy going out for coffee or tea, and if I'm home there's a near 100% chance I'm listening to a podcast.
